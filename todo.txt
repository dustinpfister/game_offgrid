## Person().nutrient[nutrientName].eatTotal

In person.js it may be better to do something like this:

    nutrient = status.nutrient[nutrientName];
    nutrient.grams = nutrient.startGrams + nutrient.eatTotal - nutrient.lossRate * totalDays;

To know value of the new eatTotal property it would be necessary to store some kind of a count of what gives an amount of a nutrient that has been consumed. Because I want to have it so there is a choice of food items to eat, that all give differing amounts of nutrients. This should be doable by simply storing a count for each food item.

At present a food item object looks something like this

var foodItem = {
    itemNumber: 0,
    desc : 'back beans 15.5oz can',
    cost : '0.65',
    uptakes : [
        {nutrient: 'protein', amount : 33},
        {nutrient: 'carbs', amount: 90}
    ]
};

So it looks like I will end up having this type of object involved in three of my *.js files. In store.js there would be a count of the stock of this item. In stuff.js there would be a count of this item that they have on hand. In addition finally I would also want to store a count of this item in person.js, that is the count of this item that has been consumed.

By knowing the count that has been consumed, it is just simply a matter of multiplying that count for each nutrient in the items uptakes array, to get an all time total for each nutrient, for the item. I would then want to do this with all food items, and add all the values together to get a number that is the total amount of grams consumed for each nutrient. Thus I will then have my nutrient.eatTotal value, that can then be used in figuring the current standing for the players nutrition.
